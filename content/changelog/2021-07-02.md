We've added a new UI in projects that allow you to visualize all the facts that you've created within the project. Those facts can come **from any customer feedback**: interview notes, Typeform surveys, and more.

Thanks to this new interface, you can **filter your facts** by tag, see the **insights attached to each fact** and **create new insights** by grouping facts together.

_It was by far the most requested feature from our users!_
