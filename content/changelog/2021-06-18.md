You can now import any Typeform survey into your projects. Thanks to this feature, you will finally be able to **mix qualitative and quantitative customer feedback**.

This prominent feature includes:

- Import any Typeform survey to Product Feedback
- Visualize all types of responses (open-ended questions, MCQ, ratings, etc.)
- Tag responses
- Create insights based on responses

When you connect a survey to Product Feedback, we import all the past entries and store all new entries that will come in the future.
